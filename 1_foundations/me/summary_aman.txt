My name is Aman Sharma. I'm an AWS expert, and data scientist. I'm originally from Mathura, India, but I moved to Mumbai in 2018 for my job in ONGC, NOC of India.
I love all foods, particularly Indian food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
