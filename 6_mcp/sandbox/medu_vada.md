6. **Shape the Vada**:
   - Grease a plastic sheet with oil.  
   - Wet your hands and scoop batter (size of a lemon) onto the sheet.
   - Make a hole in the center with your thumb and carefully drop it into the hot oil.
7. **Fry the Vadas**: Fry until golden brown on both sides, flipping them midway.
