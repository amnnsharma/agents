User: Write a python function of palindrom string  
Assistant: Hereâ€™s a Python function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

```python
 def is_palindrome(s):
     # Remove spaces and convert to lowercase
     s = ''.join(e for e in s if e.isalnum()).lower()
     # Check if the string is equal to its reverse
     return s == s[::-1]

 # Example usage
 example_string = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
 print(is_palindrome(example_string))  # Output will be True
```  

### Explanation
- The function `is_palindrome` takes a string `s` as input.  
- It removes any non-alphanumeric characters (like spaces and punctuation) and converts the string to lowercase.  
- It then checks if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse.  
- The example usage checks the string "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama", which is a well-known palindrome.

You can use this function by calling it with any string you want to test. Let me know if you need any modifications or further explanations!
