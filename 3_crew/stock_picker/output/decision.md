Companies Not Selected:
- **RM True Petroleum**: Despite its promising involvement in the biofuel sector, it is not as appealing in the immediate term compared to the expected growth trajectory of The Aligner Company.
  
- **Auto Die Cast**: While offering stability within the automotive parts die-casting market, its growth prospects are overshadowed by the dynamic expansion in the dental aligners market.

- **Mechtex**: Although it has a significant presence in automation and international markets, the rapidly growing demand for dental solutions offers a more compelling investment prospect.

- **Vinayak Ingredients**: This company faces a significant growth trajectory in health-centric animal feed supplements but lacks the exponential growth metrics projected for the dental market.
